All answers can be found in the README.md file

**1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

Git is a distributed Version Control System (VCS). Basically, its a tool that can be used to easily track changes to code, collaborating, and sharing. You can track changes that you make to projects so that yo ucan have records of what you've done--you can also revert back to older versions if necessary. It also makes collaborating with others easy.

GitHub is a develepor platform that uses the same power of Git, but online and with an easy-to-use interface. It is very popular around the software world.

**2. Explain what "committing and pushing" means in your own words. Why are these steps important?**

Comitting and pushing are how you make changes made on your local device to the remote, online repository in GitHub. This is so that the people you collaborate and share your projects with (teachers, teammates, etc.) can see the changes you make. When you make commits, you can add commit messages to remind you and/or your teammates about the changes you made. Once you have commits, you can push them so that the changes are actually added.

**3. What is a repository and what does it contain?**

A repositories are where project work happens. They are kind of like folders: they contain assets like code, files, version history, and other things related to the project being worked on. They also have READMEs. READMEs are basic introductions to your project like why it is useful, what can be done with it, and how it can be used.
